# AirAttack
A Wii U Shooting Game.

This is based on a Scratch game that I wrote during the Pandemic [Air Attack](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/378339018/). The background image and the sounds have been borrowed from [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), the rest of the images were drawn using tools in Scratch.

The game uses the overall framework and sound code from [PacMan-ish](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/PacMan-ishU), it also extends the draw code. It is based on the knowledge I gained writing PacMan-ish see [wiki](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/PacMan-ishU/wiki). The additional knowledge I gained on this game is in the [Air Attack Wiki]
